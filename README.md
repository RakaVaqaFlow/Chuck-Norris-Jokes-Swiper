## Technologies Used

- Dart programming language
- Flutter mobile app development framework
- Chuck Noris Joke API for retrieving random jokes
- Web Search API for retrieving images with Chuck Norris

**NOTE: I did not find API without restrictions, so the application may not work correctly after a certain time, since only 100 requests per day are available for my key**

## Features:

- Cards can be swiped
